# Active Domain Randomization for Training the Virtual Twin of NICO in Unity

This repository contains the source code, Unity project, and experimental setup for my Master's thesis:  
**"Active Domain Randomization for Training the Virtual Twin of NICO in Unity"**.

## Objectives

The aim of this thesis is to implement the ADR (Active Domain Randomization) into robotic infrastructure in Unity. Upon the implementation, it should be tested and verified on NICO using various tasks with different complexities. ADR will be evaluated in accordance with the most popular reinforcement learning techniques and the effectiveness for various scenarios will be measured with aim to explore the usability range and advantages of ADR.
