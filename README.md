# Active Domain Randomization for Training the Virtual Twin of NICO in Unity

This repository contains the source code, Unity project, and experimental setup for my Master's thesis:  
**"Active Domain Randomization for Training the Virtual Twin of NICO in Unity"**.

## Objectives

The aim of this thesis is to implement the ADR (Active Domain Randomization) into robotic infrastructure in Unity. Upon the implementation, it should be tested and verified on NICO using various tasks with different complexities. ADR will be evaluated in accordance with the most popular reinforcement learning techniques and the effectiveness for various scenarios will be measured with aim to explore the usability range and advantages of ADR.

## âœ… Progress Checklist

### âœ… Core Setup & Research
- âœ… Studied introductory reinforcement learning materials (Sutton & Barto, relevant papers)
- âœ… Finished Unity ML-Agents tutorials (e.g. Hummingbirds)
- âœ… Chosen Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) as the RL algorithm (based on ML-Agents implementation)
- âœ… Studied Chapter 3â€“4.6 of Sutton & Barto RL textbook
- âœ… Identified candidate paper(s) for Active Domain Randomization

### âœ… Unity & Simulation Setup
- âœ… Set up Unity project for virtual twin of NICO
- âœ… Defined NICO's movement control pipeline (Unity settings + RL output interpretation)
- âœ… Trained NICO in Unity with 10 parallel instances (stabilizes after ~15 mins)

### âœ… Experiments & Tools
- âœ… Established reproducible training setup for later comparison
- âœ… Training data is being logged for future benchmarking

### âœ… Repo & Collaboration
- âœ… GitHub repository created
- âœ… Initial trained models prepared for upload
